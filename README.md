Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview
Investors are interested in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. To solidified the proposal, Tableau is used to visualize the bike trip data. Pandas was used to change data types for the "tripduration" column. Then five visualizations were created to represent the data:
* Length of time the bikes were checked out by rider and then gender.
* Number of bike trips for riders and then gender for each hour of each day of the week.
* Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each hour of each day of the week.

## Results
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
