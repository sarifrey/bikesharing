Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview
Investors are interested in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. To solidified the proposal, Tableau is used to visualize the bike trip data. Pandas was used to change data types for the "tripduration" column. Then five visualizations were created to represent the data:
* Length of time the bikes were checked out by rider and then gender.
* Number of bike trips for riders and then gender for each hour of each day of the week.
* Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each hour of each day of the week.

## Results
The main title of the Tableau story shows the total number of rides, total bikes, the average of the customer by gender and then the customer type. One of the main takeaways is that more subscribers use the bikes than non-subscribers.

The checkout times by user shows that most customers use the bikes for less than 60 minutes.

The checkout times by gender shows that male identifying customers use the bikes more and still less than 60 minutes.

The trips by weekday per hour is heatmap that shows the concentration of usage during the morning and evening commuting hours Monday through Friday and fairly heavy usage on Saturdays.

Then looking at the frequency of bike usage by identified gender and customer type (subscriber or non-subscriber), male identifying customers use the bikes the most. The heavy usage days are Thursdays and Fridays.

## Summary
The bike sharing program is successful in New York City. The consistent heavy usage times even accounting for identified gender are the morning and evening commute hours. Then the bike usage remain consist through the weekend with Saturday a heavy use day. Male identifying customers account for the majority of bike rides. 

A bike sharing program in Des Moines could be successful by focusing on the downtown core and commuting hours.

Visualization One: how many bikes at any point in the day are in use.
Visualization Two: the most frequently used bike, where it starts and ends most frequently
